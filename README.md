```sql
create table
  public.questions_inf02 (
    id bigint generated by default as identity,
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null,
    content text not null,
    correct_answer text not null,
    image boolean not null,
    answers text[] not null,
    constraint questions_inf02_pkey primary key (id),
    constraint questions_inf02_id_key unique (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
```

```sql
create table
  public.questions_inf03 (
    id bigint generated by default as identity,
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null,
    content text not null,

    image boolean not null default false,
    answers text[] not null,
