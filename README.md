## üë§ User features
You can create an account by signing up using an email and a password, or by using one of the social login providers (currently Google and Discord are available). A single user can sign in using multiple authentication methods (e.g. if you signed up using the email johndoe[at]mail.com, you can sign in to the same account using Discord if the discord account is also linked to the johndoe[at]mail.com address). Here's the rest of the features regarding a user:
### Dashboard

### Exam history
You can access your exam score history through the "Zobacz wszystkie" button located where the 5 latest scores are displayed. Your scores are displayed in a paginated table.
Sort the scores by the date of their submission and the percentage score. Filter the scores by the exam's qualification and the percentage score (higher and/or lower than a specified value).
You can select rows on the current page and choose to delete them.

### Hardest questions page
A subpage accessible only to signed in users, which displays top 50 questions deemed by the web app's userbase to be the most difficult.
